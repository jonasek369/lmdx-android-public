# Local mangadex android app  
Local Mangadex is a project I've been working on for a while. I started this project as [local-mdx-public](https://github.com/jonasek369/local-mdx-public) made in Python and WebView. Now I've started working on an Android app. My main objective is to learn how to make mobile apps.  
  
## This project is early in development  
Even though the basic functions, such as downloading (mostly) and reading, work, it still has a lot of issues and many things lacking in the feature set. I would welcome anyone who tries this app out and finds a bug to create an issue.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Comply with Usage Policy
- [ ] Make manga downloading background with notification (something as spotify)
  - [ ] Background downloading
  - [ ] Notification
